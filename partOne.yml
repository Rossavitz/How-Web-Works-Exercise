It is a request from a user to the server.

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Headers are additional information within requests or responses.  Headers are things like accept-language, accept, cookie.


- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
The URL is turned into an IP address via a DNS. An HTTP request is made to that IP address. An HTTP response is returned.
The browser accepts and renders that code making more requests as needed for things like CSS and JavaScript files.
